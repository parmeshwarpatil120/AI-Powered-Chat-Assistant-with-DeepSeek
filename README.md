🔍 Workflow
1. User Input
The user opens the Streamlit web interface and interacts with the chatbot by typing messages.
Users can ask for advice, seek motivation, or request help with productivity and emotional well-being.
2. Message Processing
Once the user sends a message, it is captured by Streamlit and passed as input to the LangChain model.
LangChain processes the message and handles the conversation flow to ensure context is maintained.
3. Emotion Detection & Contextualization
DeepSeek (via Ollama API) analyzes the user's emotional state based on the input message.
Based on the emotional state and the topic (motivation, productivity, career advice), the system understands the user's need and context.
4. Response Generation
DeepSeek generates a personalized, context-aware response.
If the user needs motivation: "You're doing great! Break your goals into smaller tasks and celebrate each small victory!"
If the user asks for productivity tips: "Try the Pomodoro technique! Focus on tasks for 25 minutes, followed by a 5-minute break."
If the user seeks career advice: "To grow professionally, focus on improving communication skills and learning new technologies."
5. Response Presentation
The chatbot displays the generated response on the Streamlit interface in a clean and interactive chat window.
The user can read the message and decide to ask a follow-up question or seek more advice.
6. User Feedback and Adaptation
The user can continue the conversation by providing feedback or additional questions.
LangChain tracks the conversation and adapts future responses based on the history of interactions, allowing for more personalized advice.
7. Repeat the Process
The chatbot continues the loop by providing tailored responses to any new inputs, adapting to the user's needs throughout the conversation.
The AI model becomes more effective over time, providing increasingly relevant advice based on accumulated context.
